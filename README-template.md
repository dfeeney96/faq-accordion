## My process

I started by inserting the html in the given document, and then built the mobile css styles. Afterwards, I added the functionality with Vanilla JS. Finally, I added a media query to create the desktop styles.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The key challenge that I had with this task was manipulating the desktop image of the woman to not flow over the card. I learned that one way to do this was to include the image in a div and hide the overflow. 
I found the JS here to be relatively simple, but I am unsure if there are better ways to achieve the same effect. 


### Continued development

Going forward, I would like to still improve my CSS skills.
